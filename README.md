# M8A1 Create a GUI Database App

Introduction to the Activity

To this point, you’ve analyzed database requirements, designed and normalized a database, and practiced designing graphical interfaces for your database app.  As a professional software developer, there is rarely something more satisfying than seeing an app you’ve spent months working on finally put into operation.  Technology is supposed to make people’s lives easier and it’s great to sit back and watch the users’ lives enhance by all your hard work.

Now it’s time to put everything you’ve learned together.  For the final activity, you will select an application stack and design and implement a simple graphical interface to insert data into your database.

Instructions to Learners

For this assignment, you will create a small application that will interact with your database that you have been working on throughout the term.  To work towards this goal, do the following:

Think of a scenario where you might need to add records to your database (e.g., adding a new student, enrolling a student in a class). Create a mockup of what a graphical interface might look like for this scenario.  Paste this mockup into a Word document and include a paragraph justifying why this is a “good” design with support from the assigned reading.
In the high-level language of your choice, create a text-based application that prompts the user for inputs and adds a single record to a table in your database. You needn’t create a functioning GUI, but you may receive up to a 10% bonus on your assignment if you create a GUI instead of a text-based app.  This may require some extra reading and investigation to accomplish.
Paste screenshots of your code, executing program, any resulting output, and the database table(s) with new row(s) added into your Word document.
Write a paragraph justifying your choices for the language, provider, and API. Include your considerations for the environment in which this app would run, the project team that would create/maintain it, and its intended audience and purpose.
Zip all code together and submit both the Word document and the ZIP file containing your code.

Compose your work in a .doc or .docx file type using a word processor (such as Microsoft Word, etc.) and save it frequently to your computer. For those assignments that are not written essays and require uploading images or PowerPoint slides, please follow uploading guidelines provided by your instructor.
